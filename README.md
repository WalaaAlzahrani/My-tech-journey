# My Tech Journey

Welcome to my **Tech Journey** repository! 🎉  
This repository is a collection of all the projects, experiments, and learning experiences I’ve encountered throughout my journey as a developer. Each folder represents a different project or skill that I've worked on, and this will continue to grow as I learn and explore new technologies.

## 🚀 Purpose

This repository serves as a track record of my growth in technology and programming. It's a place to showcase my skills, demonstrate personal projects, and document my learning progress. As I explore new tools, frameworks, and concepts, I’ll add them to this repository.

## 📁 Projects

Here’s a list of the current projects included in this repository:

### **Project 1: Date Utilities Python Project**

- **Description**:  
  This Python project provides a collection of utilities for working with dates. It includes functions that make it easier to perform common date-related tasks, such as calculating the number of days in a given month, checking the validity of a date, finding the number of days between two dates, and calculating a person's age in days based on their birthdate.

- **Technologies Used**:  
  Python, `datetime` module, Git

- **Purpose**:  
  I created the Date Utilities Python Project to enhance my Python skills, particularly with the `datetime` module. This project helped me practice handling date calculations, such as validating dates, calculating days between dates, and determining age in days.

- **Folder Structure**:

    ```
    Date_Utilities_Python_Project/
    ├── datetime_utilities.py
    └── README.md
    └── test_datetime_utilities.py
    ```
