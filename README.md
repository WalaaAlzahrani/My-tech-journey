## 📁 Projects

Here’s a list of the current projects included in this repository:

### **Project 1: Date Utilities Python Project 📅**

- **Description**:  
  This Python project provides a collection of utilities for working with dates. It includes functions that make it easier to perform common date-related tasks, such as calculating the number of days in a given month, checking the validity of a date, finding the number of days between two dates, and calculating a person's age in days based on their birthdate.

- **Technologies Used**:  
  Python, `datetime` module, Git

- **Purpose**:  
  I created the Date Utilities Python Project to enhance my Python skills, particularly with the `datetime` module. This project helped me practice handling date calculations, such as validating dates, calculating days between dates, and determining age in days.

### **Project 4: Global Wealth Analysis (Excel Project) 📊**

- **Description**:  
  This is my first Excel project, where I analyzed the distribution of billionaires worldwide. I followed a guided project from [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/aUMEx4in2iU?si=SHrgMOKJ04SY1Vj1) to learn and apply Excel skills like Pivot Tables, Charts, and Slicers. The project provides insights into the top countries and industries with the most billionaires and their total wealth distribution.

- **Technologies Used**:  
  Microsoft Excel, Pivot Tables, Charts, Slicers

- **Purpose**:  
  I created this project to learn how to analyze and visualize financial data using Excel. This helped me understand data structuring, filtering, and interactive dashboard creation.

### **Project 5: Saudi Events Dashboard (Power BI Project) 📈**

- **Description**:  
  This Power BI project analyzes 335 events that took place in Riyadh City between January 1, 2022, and December 2, 2024. The dashboard includes insights into how holidays, weather conditions, paydays, and school schedules influence event frequency. It is structured into two main pages: **Data Overview** and **Event Analysis**.

- **Technologies Used**:  
  Power BI Desktop, Data Visualization

- **Purpose**:  
  I created the Saudi Events Dashboard to practice building interactive reports using Power BI. This project improved my skills in data modeling, trend analysis, and dashboard design focused on real-world contextual insights.
